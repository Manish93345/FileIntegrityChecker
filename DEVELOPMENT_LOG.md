### Phase 8.2 — Severity Engine
- INFO / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL classification
- Severity-aware alerts

### Phase 8.3 — Auto Response & Safe Mode
- Automated actions per severity
- SAFE MODE on CRITICAL incidents
- Incident snapshot generation

---

## 🗓️ Phase 9 — Cleanup & Demo Mode
- Production folder structure
