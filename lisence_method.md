## Method 1: The Online Activation Server (Most Common)
This is how most modern software works.

The Purchase: The user pays you on a website (using Stripe, Gumroad, etc.).

The Generation: Your website generates a random string (A1B2...) and saves it in a secure cloud database (like Firebase or AWS) with the status Active - Premium.

The App Check: The user pastes that key into your app. Your Python app sends a web request to your server: "Hey Server, is A1B2... a real key?"

The Response: The server checks its database and replies: "Yes, and it belongs to a Premium tier."

The Lock-In: Your app then updates the local users.json to "premium", but it also saves a cryptographic token from the server so the user can't just edit the JSON file manually later.

## Method 2: Offline Cryptographic Keys (Best for Desktop Apps)
If your app is meant to work offline (which security tools often are), you can't rely on checking a server. You use Cryptography—which you already used for your log files!

Instead of a random string, the License Key is a mathematically generated equation.

You have a highly guarded Private Key on your personal computer.

You use it to generate a license string based on the user's name: Manish-Premium-Signature12345.

Your app has a Public Key hardcoded inside integrity_core.py.

When the user enters the key, the app does math to check: "Was this string generated by my creator's Private Key?"

If yes, it unlocks. If a user tries to guess a key or edit the file, the math fails, and the app reverts to Free.
